A personal website circa 2010

Introducing oneself via cool code :3


This repo was made a while ago! I was in a slump and abandoned the idea, however....
Thanks to athena, I decided to try again!

Athena qs
What is your project?
- This is Morimo and it's just a simple placeholder/lab rat for my personal website! TLDR I just wanted to try making something to introduce myself digitally without being boring

Why did you make your project?
- Again, I wanted to be able to ntroduce myself without just typing a super long paragraph in the slack - also, just to practice my js skills (my first time using js in a solo project)

How you made your project
- I used github codespaces on the school chromebook i had to bring with me on an airplane flight to the opposite side of the world. Yes, the entire thing was made on an airplane. Coded with html, css, and javascript

Struggles? What did you learn?
- I knew it would be a challenge but uh the draggable and resizable windows that pop up when you click the buttons were a NIGHTMARE. To say the least, my airplane seat-mates were concerned/scared (???). I'm happy it didn't actually take too long to figure out though. 
I strugggled a little with the js since I never really learned it but uh I think it turned out decently - huge learning curve in the ~4 hours spent on this project.

ALSO - This does NOT look like a 2010s website - totally a work in progress that I will be adding to in the future.
